You had a few test cases fail related to a number of things. First off, looks like you're using global constants in your Board.hpp file (-5pts). Furthermore, you have some bugs in your readGameFile method. I would not recommend using using a do / while loop. In this case, you'll only get headaches. What if the file is empty? What if the file is invalid? You don't want to "do" anything first before you check that hte game file is ready to go. The way you have it right now is fine, but you neglect closing the game file in error case (-10pts). Your makeMove logic is also flawed. The way you have it now is to proceed if the space is empty or is not an 'o'. This should only proceed if the space is empty. You're essentially allowing the game to override older x / o values with the same values. (-10 pts). Please feel free to email me if you have any questions!!! mcbridej@oregonstate.edu
