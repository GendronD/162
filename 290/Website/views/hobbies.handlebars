    <h1>Books</h1>
    <p id="reading">As a kid, I always loved reading. I usually read whatever I could get my hands on, and most of the time, they weren't
        very good. As I got older, I began to put more research into what I was reading and started making better choices.
        Once in highschool, I found my self reading less and less. Too focused on school, sports, a social life; I lost my
        way with them and read very little. Between then and college, I read almost nothing outside of curriculum. Until
        one night my freshman year at Rutgers I found myself with the time mindset to read. I grabbed Salems Lot by Stephen
        King and dug in. The next night, I finished at about 3AM completely stricken by how great a book it was (and slightly
        scared of windows). It was then that I decided to make a return to my hold hobby for good. Though, time was scarce
        as it is with any college student. I finally bit into this full force once I graduated. Since then, I've read 45
        books in counting. Below you'll find an excerpt from the first book of one of my favorite series The Stormlight Archive
        by Brandon Sanderson. This past year, I've completely torn through his books and highly recommend them.</p>

    <h3>To Kill</h3>
    <i>“The love of men is a frigid thing, a mountain stream only three steps from the ice. We are his. Oh Stormfather . . .
        we are his. It is but a thousand days, and the Everstorm comes.”</i> — Collected on the first day of the week Palah
    of the month Shash of the year 1171, thirty-one seconds before death. Subject was a darkeyed pregnant woman of middle
    years. The child did not survive.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h5>4500 YEARS LATER </h5>
    <br> Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, wore white on the day he was to kill a king. The white clothing was a
    Parshendi tradition, foreign to him. But he did as his masters required and did not ask for an explanation. He sat in
    a large stone room, baked by enormous firepits that cast a garish light upon the revelers, causing beads of sweat to
    form on their skin as they danced, and drank, and yelled, and sang, and clapped. Some fell to the ground red-faced, the
    revelry too much for them, their stomachs proving to be inferior wineskins. They looked as if they were dead, at least
    until their friends carried them out of the feast hall to waiting beds. Szeth did not sway to the drums, drink the sapphire
    wine, or stand to dance. He sat on a bench at the back, a still servant in white robes. Few at the treaty-signing celebration
    noticed him. He was just a servant, and Shin were easy to ignore. Most out here in the East thought Szeth’s kind were
    docile and harmless. They were generally right. The drummers began a new rhythm. The beats shook Szeth like a quartet
    of thumping hearts, pumping waves of invisible blood through the room. Szeth’s masters—who were dismissed as savages
    by those in more civilized kingdoms—sat at their own tables. They were men with skin of black marbled with red. Parshendi,
    they were named—cousins to the more docile servant peoples known as parshmen in most of the world. An oddity. They did
    not call themselves Parshendi; this was the Alethi name for them. It meant, roughly, “parshmen who can think.” Neither
    side seemed to see that as an insult. The Parshendi had brought the musicians. At first, the Alethi lighteyes had been
    hesitant. To them, drums were base instruments of the common, darkeyed people. But wine was the great assassin of both
    tradition and propriety, and now the Alethi elite danced with abandon. Szeth stood and began to pick his way through
    the room. The revelry had lasted long; even the king had retired hours ago. But many still celebrated. As he walked,
    Szeth was forced to step around Dalinar Kholin—the king’s own brother—who slumped drunken at a small table. The aging
    but powerfully built man kept waving away those who tried to encourage him to bed. Where was Jasnah, the king’s daughter?
    Elhokar, the king’s son and heir, sat at the high table, ruling the feast in his father’s absence. He was in conversation
    with two men, a dark-skinned Azish man who had an odd patch of pale skin on his cheek and a thinner, Alethi-looking man
    who kept glancing over his shoulder. The heir’s feasting companions were unimportant. Szeth stayed far from the heir,
    skirting the sides of the room, passing the drummers. Musicspren zipped through the air around them, the tiny spirits
    taking the form of spinning translucent ribbons. As Szeth passed the drummers, they noted him. They would withdraw soon,
    along with all of the other Parshendi. They did not seem offended. They did not seem angry. And yet they were going to
    break their treaty of only a few hours. It made no sense. But Szeth did not ask questions. At the edge of the room, he
    passed rows of unwavering azure lights that bulged out where wall met floor. They held sapphires infused with Stormlight.
    Profane. How could the men of these lands use something so sacred for mere illumination? Worse, the Alethi scholars were
    said to be close to creating new Shardblades. Szeth hoped that was just wishful boasting. For if it didhappen, the world
    would be changed. Likely in a way that ended with people in all countries—from distant Thaylenah to towering Jah Keved—speaking
    Alethi to their children. They were a grand people, these Alethi. Even drunk, there was a natural nobility to them. Tall
    and well made, the men dressed in dark silk coats that buttoned down the sides of the chest and were elaborately embroidered
    in silver or gold. Each one looked a general on the field. The women were even more splendid. They wore grand silk dresses,
    tightly fitted, the bright colors a contrast to the dark tones favored by the men. The left sleeve of each dress was
    longer than the right one, covering the hand. Alethi had an odd sense of propriety. Their pure black hair was pinned
    up atop their heads, either in intricate weavings of braids or in loose piles. It was often woven with gold ribbons or
    ornaments, along with gems that glowed with Stormlight. Beautiful. Profane, but beautiful. Szeth left the feasting chamber
    behind. Just outside, he passed the doorway into the Beggars’ Feast. It was an Alethi tradition, a room where some of
    the poorest men and women in the city were given a feast complementing that of the king and his guests. A man with a
    long grey and black beard slumped in the doorway, smiling foolishly—though whether from wine or a weak mind, Szeth could
    not tell. “Have you seen me?” the man asked with slurred speech. He laughed, then began to speak in gibberish, reaching
    for a wineskin. So it was drink after all. Szeth brushed by, continuing past a line of statues depicting the Ten Heralds
    from ancient Vorin theology. Jezerezeh, Ishi, Kelek, Talenelat. He counted off each one, and realized there were only
    nine here. One was conspicuously missing. Why had Shalash’s statue been removed? King Gavilar was said to be very devout
    in his Vorin worship. Too devout, by some people’s standards. The hallway here curved to the right, running around the
    perimeter of the domed palace. They were on the king’s floor, two levels up, surrounded by rock walls, ceiling, and floor.
    That was profane. Stone was not to be trod upon. But what was he to do? He was Truthless. He did as his masters demanded.
    Today, that included wearing white. Loose white trousers tied at the waist with a rope, and over them a filmy shirt with
    long sleeves, open at the front. White clothing for a killer was a tradition among the Parshendi. Although Szeth had
    not asked, his masters had explained why. White to be bold. White to not blend into the night. White to give warning.
    For if you were going to assassinate a man, he was entitled to see you coming. Szeth turned right, taking the hallway
    directly toward the king’s chambers. Torches burned on the walls, their light unsatisfying to him, a meal of thin broth
    after a long fast. Tiny flamespren danced around them, like insects made solely of congealed light. The torches were
    useless to him. He reached for his pouch and the spheres it contained, but then hesitated when he saw more of the blue
    lights ahead: a pair of Stormlight lamps hanging on the wall, brilliant sapphires glowing at their hearts. Szeth walked
    up to one of these, holding out his hand to cup it around the glass-shrouded gemstone. “You there!” a voice called in
    Alethi. There were two guards at the intersection. Double guard, for there were savages abroad in Kholinar this night.
    True, those savages were supposed to be allies now. But alliances could be shallow things indeed. This one wouldn’t last
    the hour. Szeth looked as the two guards approached. They carried spears; they weren’t lighteyes, and were therefore
    forbidden the sword. Their painted red breastplates were ornate, however, as were their helms. They might be darkeyed,
    but they were high-ranking citizens with honored positions in the royal guard. Stopping a few feet away, the guard at
    the front gestured with his spear. “Go on, now. This is no place for you.” He had tan Alethi skin and a thin mustache
    that ran all the way around his mouth, becoming a beard at the bottom. Szeth didn’t move. “Well?” the guard said. “What
    are you waiting for?” Szeth breathed in deeply, drawing forth the Stormlight. It streamed into him, siphoned from the
    twin sapphire lamps on the walls, sucked in as if by his deep inhalation. The Stormlight raged inside of him, and the
    hallway suddenly grew darker, falling into shade like a hilltop cut off from the sun by a transient cloud. Szeth could
    feel the Light’s warmth, its fury, like a tempest that had been injected directly into his veins. The power of it was
    invigorating but dangerous. It pushed him to act. To move. To strike. Holding his breath, he clung to the Stormlight.
    He could still feel it leaking out. Stormlight could be held for only a short time, a few minutes at most. It leaked
    away, the human body too porous a container. He had heard that the Voidbringers could hold it in perfectly. But, then,
    did they even exist? His punishment declared that they didn’t. His honor demanded that they did. Afire with holy energy,
    Szeth turned to the guards. They could see that he was leaking Stormlight, wisps of it curling from his skin like luminescent
    smoke. The lead guard squinted, frowning. Szeth was sure the man had never seen anything like it before. As far as he
    knew, Szeth had killed every stonewalker who had ever seen what he could do. “What . . . what are you?” The guard’s voice
    had lost its certainty. “Spirit or man?” “What am I?” Szeth whispered, a bit of Light leaking from his lips as he looked
    past the man down the long hallway. “I’m . . . sorry.” Szeth blinked, Lashing himself to that distant point down the
    hallway. Stormlight raged from him in a flash, chilling his skin, and the ground immediately stopped pulling him downward.
    Instead, he was pulled toward that distant point—it was as if, to him, that direction had suddenly become down. This
    was a Basic Lashing, first of his three kinds of Lashings. It gave him the ability to manipulate what ever force, spren,
    or god it was that held men to the ground. With this Lashing, he could bind people or objects to different surfaces or
    in different directions. From Szeth’s perspective, the hallway was now a deep shaft down which he was falling, and the
    two guards stood on one of the sides. They were shocked when Szeth’s feet hit them, one for each face, throwing them
    over. Szeth shifted his view and Lashed himself to the floor. Light leaked from him. The floor of the hallway again became
    down, and he landed between the two guards, clothes crackling and dropping flakes of frost. He rose, beginning the process
    of summoning his Shardblade. One of the guards fumbled for his spear. Szeth reached down, touching the soldier’s shoulder
    while looking up. He focused on a point above him while willing the Light out of his body and into the guard, Lashing
    the poor man to the ceiling. The guard yelped in shock as up became down for him. Light trailing from his form, he crashed
    into the ceiling and dropped his spear. It was not Lashed directly, and clattered back down to the floor near Szeth.
    To kill. It was the greatest of sins. And yet here Szeth stood, Truthless, profanely walking on stones used for building.
    And it would not end. As Truthless, there was only one life he was forbidden to take. And that was his own. At the tenth
    beat of his heart, his Shardblade dropped into his waiting hand. It formed as if condensing from mist, water beading
    along the metal length. His Shardblade was long and thin, edged on both sides, smaller than most others. Szeth swept
    it out, carving a line in the stone floor and passing through the second guard’s neck. As always, the Shardblade killed
    oddly; though it cut easily through stone, steel, or anything inanimate, the metal fuzzed when it touched living skin.
    It traveled through the guard’s neck without leaving a mark, but once it did, the man’s eyes smoked and burned. They
    blackened, shriveling up in his head, and he slumped forward, dead. A Shardblade did not cut living flesh; it severed
    the soul itself. Above, the first guard gasped. He’d managed to get to his feet, even though they were planted on the
    ceiling of the hallway. “Shardbearer!” he shouted. “A Shardbearer assaults the king’s hall! To arms!” Finally, Szeth
    thought. Szeth’s use of Stormlight was unfamiliar to the guards, but they knew a Shardblade when they saw one. Szeth
    bent down and picked up the spear that had fallen from above. As he did so, he released the breath he’d been holding
    since drawing in the Stormlight. It sustained him while he held it, but those two lanterns hadn’t contained much of it,
    so he would need to breathe again soon. The Light began to leak away more quickly, now that he wasn’t holding his breath.
    Szeth set the spear’s butt against the stone floor, then looked upward. The guard above stopped shouting, eyes opening
    wide as the tails of his shirt began to slip downward, the earth below reasserting its dominance. The Light steaming
    off his body dwindled. He looked down at Szeth. Down at the spear tip pointing directly at his heart. Violet fearspren
    crawled out of the stone ceiling around him. The Light ran out. The guard fell. He screamed as he hit, the spear impaling
    him through the chest. Szeth let the spear fall away, carried to the ground with a muffled thump by the body twitching
    on its end. Shardblade in hand, he turned down a side corridor, following the map he’d memorized. He ducked around a
    corner and flattened himself against the wall just as a troop of guards reached the dead men. The newcomers began shouting
    immediately, continuing the alarm. His instructions were clear. Kill the king, but be seen doing it. Let the Alethi know
    he was coming and what he was doing. Why? Why did the Parshendi agree to this treaty, only to send an assassin the very
    night of its signing? More gemstones glowed on the walls of the hallway here. King Gavilar liked lavish display, and
    he couldn’t know that he was leaving sources of power for Szeth to use in his Lashings. The things Szeth did hadn’t been
    seen for millennia. Histories from those times were all but nonexistent, and the legends were horribly inaccurate. Szeth
    peeked back out into the corridor. One of the guards at the intersection saw him, pointing and yelling. Szeth made sure
    they got a good look, then ducked away. He took a deep breath as he ran, drawing in Stormlight from the lanterns. His
    body came alive with it, and his speed increased, his muscles bursting with energy. Light became a storm inside of him;
    his blood thundered in his ears. It was terrible and wonderful at the same time. Two corridors down, one to the side.
    He threw open the door of a storage room, then hesitated a moment—just long enough for a guard to round the corner and
    see him—before dashing into the room. Preparing for a Full Lashing, he raised his arm and commanded the Stormlight to
    pool there, causing the skin to burst alight with radiance. Then he flung his hand out toward the doorframe, spraying
    white luminescence across it like paint. He slammed the door just as the guards arrived. The Stormlight held the door
    in the frame with the strength of a hundred arms. A Full Lashing bound objects together, holding them fast until the
    Stormlight ran out. It took longer to create—and drained Stormlight far more quickly—than a Basic Lashing. The door handle
    shook, and then the wood began to crack as the guards threw their weight against it, one man calling for an axe. Szeth
    crossed the room in rapid strides, weaving around the shrouded furniture that had been stored here. It was of red cloth
    and deep expensive woods. He reached the far wall and—preparing himself for yet another blasphemy—he raised his Shardblade
    and slashed horizontally through the dark grey stone. The rock sliced easily; a Shardblade could cut any inanimate object.
    Two vertical slashes followed, then one across the bottom, cutting a large square block. He pressed his hand against
    it, willing Stormlight into the stone. Behind him the room’s door began to crack. He looked over his shoulder and focused
    on the shaking door, Lashing the block in that direction. Frost crystallized on his clothing—Lashing something so large
    required a great deal of Stormlight. The tempest within him stilled, like a storm reduced to a drizzle. He stepped aside.
    The large stone block shuddered, sliding into the room. Normally, moving the block would have been impossible. Its own
    weight would have held it against the stones below. Yet now, that same weight pulled it free; for the block, the direction
    of the room’s door was down. With a deep grinding sound, the block slid free of the wall and tumbled through the air,
    smashing furniture. The soldiers finally broke through the door, staggering into the room just as the enormous block
    crashed into them. Szeth turned his back on the terrible sound of the screams, the splintering of wood, the breaking
    of bones. He ducked and stepped through his new hole, entering the hallway outside. He walked slowly, drawing Stormlight
    from the lamps he passed, siphoning it to him and stoking anew the tempest within. As the lamps dimmed, the corridor
    darkened. A thick wooden door stood at the end, and as he approached, small fearspren—shaped like globs of purple goo—began
    to wriggle from the masonry, pointing toward the doorway. They were drawn by the terror being felt on the other side.
    Szeth pushed the door open, entering the last corridor leading to the king’s chambers. Tall, red ceramic vases lined
    the pathway, and they were interspersed with nervous soldiers. They flanked a long, narrow rug. It was red, like a river
    of blood. The spearmen in front didn’t wait for him to get close. They broke into a trot, lifting their short throwing
    spears. Szeth slammed his hand to the side, pushing Stormlight into the doorframe, using the third and final type of
    Lashing, a Reverse Lashing. This one worked diff erently from the other two. It did not make the doorframe emit Stormlight;
    indeed, it seemed to pull nearby light into it, giving it a strange penumbra. The spearmen threw, and Szeth stood still,
    hand on the doorframe. A Reverse Lashing required his constant touch, but took comparatively little Stormlight. During
    one, anything that approached him—particularly lighter objects—was instead pulled toward the Lashing itself. The spears
    veered in the air, splitting around him and slamming into the wooden frame. As he felt them hit, Szeth leaped into the
    air and Lashed himself to the right wall, his feet hitting the stone with a slap. He immediately re oriented his perspective.
    To his eyes, he wasn’t standing on the wall, the soldiers were, the blood-red carpet streaming between them like a long
    tapestry. Szeth bolted down the hallway, striking with his Shardblade, shearing through the necks of two men who had
    thrown spears at him. Their eyes burned, and they collapsed. The other guards in the hallway began to panic. Some tried
    to attack him, others yelled for more help, still others cringed away from him. The attackers had trouble—they were disoriented
    by the oddity of striking at someone who hung on the wall. Szeth cut down a few, then flipped into the air, tucking into
    a roll, and Lashed himself back to the floor. He hit the ground in the midst of the soldiers. Completely surrounded,
    but holding a Shardblade. According to legend, the Shardblades were first carried by the Knights Radiant uncounted ages
    ago. Gifts of their god, granted to allow them to fight horrors of rock and flame, dozens of feet tall, foes whose eyes
    burned with hatred. The Voidbringers. When your foe had skin as hard as stone itself, steel was useless. Something supernal
    was required. Szeth rose from his crouch, loose white clothes rippling, jaw clenched against his sins. He struck out,
    his weapon flashing with reflected torchlight. Elegant, wide swings. Three of them, one after another. He could neither
    close his ears to the screams that followed nor avoid seeing the men fall. They dropped round him like toys knocked over
    by a child’s careless kick. If the Blade touched a man’s spine, he died, eyes burning. If it cut through the core of
    a limb, it killed that limb. One soldier stumbled away from Szeth, arm flopping uselessly on his shoulder. He would never
    be able to feel it or use it again. Szeth lowered his Shardblade, standing among the cinder-eyed corpses. Here, in Alethkar,
    men often spoke of the legends—of mankind’s hardwon victory over the Voidbringers. But when weapons created to fight
    nightmares were turned against common soldiers, the lives of men became cheap things indeed. Szeth turned and continued
    on his way, slippered feet falling on the soft red rug. The Shardblade, as always, glistened silver and clean. When one
    killed with a Blade, there was no blood. That seemed like a sign. The Shardblade was just a tool; it could not be blamed
    for the murders. The door at the end of the hallway burst open. Szeth froze as a small group of soldiers rushed out,
    ushering a man in regal robes, his head ducked as if to avoid arrows. The soldiers wore deep blue, the color of the King’s
    Guard, and the corpses didn’t make them stop and gawk. They were prepared for what a Shardbearer could do. They opened
    a side door and shoved their ward through, several leveling spears at Szeth as they backed out. Another figure stepped
    from the king’s quarters; he wore glistening blue armor made of smoothly interlocking plates. Unlike common plate armor,
    however, this armor had no leather or mail visible at the joints—just smaller plates, fitting together with intricate
    precision. The armor was beautiful, the blue inlaid with golden bands around the edges of each piece of plate, the helm
    ornamented with three waves of small, hornlike wings. Shardplate, the customary complement to a Shardblade. The newcomer
    carried a sword as well, an enormous Shardblade six feet long with a design along the blade like burning flames, a weapon
    of silvery metal that gleamed and almost seemed to glow. A weapon designed to slay dark gods, a larger counterpart to
    the one Szeth carried. Szeth hesitated. He didn’t recognize the armor; he had not been warned that he would be set at
    this task, and hadn’t been given proper time to memorize the various suits of Plate or Blades owned by the Alethi. But
    a Shardbearer would have to be dealt with before he chased the king; he could not leave such a foe behind. Besides, perhaps
    a Shardbearer could defeat him, kill him and end his miserable life. His Lashings wouldn’t work directly on someone in
    Shardplate, and the armor would enhance the man, strengthen him. Szeth’s honor would not allow him to betray his mission
    or seek death. But if that death occurred, he would welcome it. The Shardbearer struck, and Szeth Lashed himself to the
    side of the hallway, leaping with a twist and landing on the wall. He danced backward, Blade held at the ready. The Shardbearer
    fell into an aggressive posture, using one of the swordplay stances favored here in the East. He moved far more nimbly
    than one would expect for a man in such bulky armor. Shardplate was special, as ancient and magical as the Blades it
    complemented. The Shardbearer struck. Szeth skipped to the side and Lashed himself to the ceiling as the Shardbearer’s
    Blade sliced into the wall. Feeling a thrill at the contest, Szeth dashed forward and attacked downward with an overhand
    blow, trying to hit the Shardbearer’s helm. The man ducked, going down on one knee, letting Szeth’s Blade cleave empty
    air. Szeth leaped backward as the Shardbearer swung upward with his Blade, slicing into the ceiling. Szeth didn’t own
    a set of Plate himself, and didn’t care to. His Lashings interfered with the gemstones that powered Shardplate, and he
    had to choose one or the other. As the Shardbearer turned, Szeth sprinted forward across the ceiling. As expected, the
    Shardbearer swung again, and Szeth leaped to the side, rolling. He came up from his roll and flipped, Lashing himself
    to the floor again. He spun to land on the ground behind the Shardbearer. He slammed his Blade into his opponent’s open
    back. Unfortunately, there was one major advantage Plate offered: It could block a Shardblade. Szeth’s weapon hit solidly,
    causing a web of glowing lines to spread out across the back of the armor, and Stormlight began to leak free from them.
    Shardplate didn’t dent or bend like common metal. Szeth would have to hit the Shardbearer in the same location at least
    once more to break through. Szeth danced out of range as the Shardbearer swung in anger, trying to cut at Szeth’s knees.
    The tempest within Szeth gave him many advantages—including the ability to quickly recover from small wounds. But it
    would not restore limbs killed by a Shardblade. He rounded the Shardbearer, then picked a moment and dashed forward.
    The Shardbearer swung again, but Szeth briefly Lashed himself to the ceiling for lift. He shot into the air, cresting
    over the swing, then immediately Lashed himself back to the floor. He struck as he landed, but the Shardbearer recovered
    quickly and executed a perfect follow-through stroke, coming within a finger of hitting Szeth. The man was dangerously
    skilled with that Blade. Many Shardbearers depended too much on the power of their weapon and armor. This man was different.
    Szeth jumped to the wall and struck at the Shardbearer with quick, terse attacks, like a snapping eel. The Shardbearer
    fended him off with wide, sweeping counters. His Blade’s length kept Szeth at bay. This is taking too long! Szeth thought.
    If the king slipped away into hiding, Szeth would fail in his mission no matter how many people he killed. He ducked
    in for another strike, but the Shardbearer forced him back. Each second this fight lasted was another for the king’s
    escape. It was time to be reckless. Szeth launched into the air, Lashing himself to the other end of the hallway and
    falling feet-first toward his adversary. The Shardbearer didn’t hesitate to swing, but Szeth Lashed himself down at an
    angle, dropping immediately. The Shardblade swished through the air above him. He landed in a crouch, using his momentum
    to throw himself forward, and swung at the Shardbearer’s side, where the Plate had cracked. He hit with a powerful blow.
    That piece of the Plate shattered, bits of molten metal streaking away. The Shardbearer grunted, dropping to one knee,
    raising a hand to his side. Szeth raised a foot to the man’s side and shoved him backward with a Stormlight-enhanced
    kick. The heavy Shardbearer crashed into the door of the king’s quarters, smashing it and falling partway into the room
    beyond. Szeth left him, ducking instead through the doorway to the right, following the way the king had gone. The hallway
    here had the same red carpet, and Stormlight lamps on the walls gave Szeth a chance to recharge the tempest within. Energy
    blazed within him again, and he sped up. If he could get far enough ahead, he could deal with the king, then turn back
    to fight off the Shardbearer. It wouldn’t be easy. A Full Lashing on a doorway wouldn’t stop a Shardbearer, and that
    Plate would let the man run supernaturally fast. Szeth glanced over his shoulder. The Shardbearer wasn’t following. The
    man sat up in his armor, looking dazed. Szeth could just barely see him, sitting in the doorway, surrounded by broken
    bits of wood. Perhaps Szeth had wounded him more than he’d thought. Or maybe . . . Szeth froze. He thought of the ducked
    head of the man who’d been rushed out, face obscured. The Shardbearer still wasn’t following. He was so skilled. It was
    said that few men could rival Gavilar Kholin’s swordsmanship. Could it be? Szeth turned and dashed back, trusting his
    instincts. As soon as the Shardbearer saw him, he climbed to his feet with alacrity. Szeth ran faster. What was the safest
    place for your king? In the hands of some guards, fleeing? Or protected in a suit of Shardplate, left behind, dismissed
    as a bodyguard? Clever, Szeth thought as the formerly sluggish Shardbearer fell into another battle stance. Szeth attacked
    with renewed vigor, swinging his Blade in a flurry of strikes. The Shardbearer—the king—aggressively struck out with
    broad, sweeping blows. Szeth pulled away from one of these, feeling the wind of the weapon passing just inches before
    him. He timed his next move, then dashed forward, ducking underneath the king’s follow-through. The king, expecting another
    strike at his side, twisted with his arm held protectively to block the hole in his Plate. That gave Szeth the room to
    run past him and into the king’s chambers. The king spun around to follow, but Szeth ran through the lavishly furnished
    chamber, flinging out his hand, touching pieces of furniture he passed. He infused them with Stormlight, Lashing them
    to a point behind the king. The furniture tumbled as if the room had been turned on its side, couches, chairs, and tables
    dropping toward the surprised king. Gavilar made the mistake of chopping at them with his Shardblade. The weapon easily
    sheared through a large couch, but the pieces still crashed into him, making him stumble. A footstool hit him next, throwing
    him to the ground. Gavilar rolled out of the way of the furniture and charged forward, Plate leaking streams of Light
    from the cracked sections. Szeth gathered himself, then leaped into the air, Lashing himself backward and to the right
    as the king arrived. He zipped out of the way of the king’s blow, then Lashed himself forward with two Basic Lashings
    in a row. Stormlight flashed out of him, clothing freezing, as he was pulled toward the king at twice the speed of a
    normal fall. The king’s posture indicated surprise as Szeth lurched in midair, then spun toward him, swinging. He slammed
    his Blade into the king’s helm, then immediately Lashed himself to the ceiling and fell upward, slamming into the stone
    roof above. He’d Lashed himself in too many directions too quickly, and his body had lost track, making it difficult
    to land gracefully. He stumbled back to his feet. Below, the king stepped back, trying to get into position to swing
    up at Szeth. The man’s helm was cracked, leaking Stormlight, and he stood protectively, defending the side with the broken
    plate. The king used a onehanded swing, reaching for the ceiling. Szeth immediately Lashed himself downward, judging
    that the king’s attack would leave him unable to get his sword back in time. Szeth underestimated his opponent. The king
    stepped into Szeth’s attack, trusting his helm to absorb the blow. Just as Szeth hit the helm a second time—shattering
    it—Gavilar punched with his off hand, slamming his gauntleted fist into Szeth’s face. Blinding light flashed in Szeth’s
    eyes, a counterpoint to the sudden agony that crashed across his face. Everything blurred, his vision fading. Pain. So
    much pain! He screamed, Stormlight leaving him in a rush, and he slammed back into something hard. The balcony doors.
    More pain broke out across his shoulders, as if someone had stabbed him with a hundred daggers, and he hit the ground
    and rolled to a stop, muscles trembling. The blow would have killed an ordinary man. No time for pain. No time for pain.
    No time for pain! He blinked, shaking his head, the world blurry and dark. Was he blind? No. It was dark outside. He
    was on the wooden balcony; the force of the blow had thrown him through the doors. Something was thumping. Heavy footfalls.
    The Shardbearer! Szeth stumbled to his feet, vision swimming. Blood streamed from the side of his face, and Stormlight
    rose from his skin, blinding his left eye. The Light. It would heal him, if it could. His jaw felt unhinged. Broken?
    He’d dropped his Shardblade. A lumbering shadow moved in front of him; the Shardbearer’s armor had leaked enough Stormlight
    that the king was having trouble walking. But he was coming. Szeth screamed, kneeling, infusing Stormlight into the wooden
    balcony, Lashing it downward. The air frosted around him. The tempest roared, traveling down his arms into the wood.
    He Lashed it downward, then did it again. He Lashed a fourth time as Gavilar stepped onto the balcony. It lurched under
    the extra weight. The wood cracked, straining. The Shardbearer hesitated. Szeth Lashed the balcony downward a fifth time.
    The balcony supports shattered and the entire structure broke free from the building. Szeth screamed through a broken
    jaw and used his final bit of Stormlight to Lash himself to the side of the building. He fell to the side, passing the
    shocked Shardbearer, then hit the wall and rolled. The balcony dropped away, the king looking up with shock as he lost
    his footing. The fall was brief. In the moonlight, Szeth watched solemnly—vision still fuzzy, blinded in one eye—as the
    structure crashed to the stone ground below. The wall of the palace trembled, and the crash of broken wood echoed from
    the nearby buildings. Still standing on the side of the wall, Szeth groaned, climbing to his feet. He felt weak; he’d
    used up his Stormlight too quickly, straining his body. He stumbled down the side of the building, approaching the wreckage,
    barely able to remain standing. The king was still moving. Shardplate would protect a man from such a fall, but a large
    length of bloodied wood stuck up through Gavilar’s side, piercing him where Szeth had broken the Plate earlier. Szeth
    knelt down, inspecting the man’s pain-wracked face. Strong features, square chin, black beard flecked with white, striking
    pale green eyes. Gavilar Kholin. “I . . . expected you . . . to come,” the king said between gasps. Szeth reached underneath
    the front of the man’s breastplate, tapping the straps there. They unfastened, and he pulled the front of the breastplate
    free, exposing the gemstones on its interior. Two had been cracked and burned out. Three still glowed. Numb, Szeth breathed
    in sharply, absorbing the Light. The storm began to rage again. More Light rose from the side of his face, repairing
    his damaged skin and bones. The pain was still great; Stormlight healing was far from instantaneous. It would be hours
    before he recovered. The king coughed. “You can tell . . . Thaidakar . . . that he’s too late. . . .” “I don’t know who
    that is,” Szeth said, standing, his words slurring from his broken jaw. He held his hand to the side, resummoning his
    Shardblade. The king frowned. “Then who . . . ? Restares? Sadeas? I never thought . . .” “My masters are the Parshendi,”
    Szeth said. Ten heartbeats passed, and his Blade dropped into his hand, wet with condensation. “The Parshendi? That makes
    no sense.” Gavilar coughed, hand quivering, reaching toward his chest and fumbling at a pocket. He pulled out a small
    crystalline sphere tied to a chain. “You must take this. They must not get it.” He seemed dazed. “Tell . . . tell my
    brother . . . he must find the most important words a man can say. . . .” Gavilar fell still. Szeth hesitated, then knelt
    down and took the sphere. It was odd, unlike any he’d seen before. Though it was completely dark, it seemed to glow somehow.
    With a light that was black. The Parshendi? Gavilar had said. That makes no sense. “Nothing makes sense anymore,” Szeth
    whispered, tucking the strange sphere away. “It’s all unraveling. I am sorry, King of the Alethi. I doubt that you care.
    Not anymore, at least.” He stood up. “At least you won’t have to watch the world ending with the rest of us.” Beside
    the king’s body, his Shardblade materialized from mist, clattering to the stones now that its master was dead. It was
    worth a fortune; kingdoms had fallen as men vied to possess a single Shardblade. Shouts of alarm came from inside the
    palace. Szeth needed to go. But . . . Tell my brother . . . To Szeth’s people, a dying request was sacred. He took the
    king’s hand, dipping it in the man’s own blood, then used it to scrawl on the wood, Brother. You must find the most important
    words a man can say. With that, Szeth escaped into the night. He left the king’s Shardblade; he had no use for it. The
    Blade Szeth already carried was curse enough.

    <h1 id="sTitle">Succulents and Gardening</h1>
    <p id="garden">I first started working in the garden as a kid. My brothers and I would always get dropped off at our Grandma's and she
        would have us work her garden. At the time, I didn't enjoy it at all. However, she did give us pocket change to buy
        treats with. Once we packed up and moved to New Jersey, my family had many garden beds and vegetable plants. Eventually,
        I created a large garden space as part of a Boy Scout project where my parents were able to grow a large number of
        plants. Being able to eat fresh vegetabkes from the garden was an absolute joy, and I couldn't wait to have my own
        garden. Fast forward to now - I've moved out and I'm livng in Brooklyn. I have a large array of Succulents that I've
        kept for the last two years and just constructed my first vegetable garden. (A Progress Post will be soon to come).</p>
